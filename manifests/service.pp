    #       update Slurm RPMs. The interactions with GPFS, between daemons,
    #       during schema updates, etc. make it too risky (in Jake's opinion)
    #       to have Puppet start these services. As a result, we will NOT
    #       start them at boot or via Slurm. They should be started manually,
    #       first slurmdbd, then slurmctld.
